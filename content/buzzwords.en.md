Below is a partial list of tools that I have used in companies or private projects. Some are familiar to me, while others less so. I currently use some and not others temporarily.

In my opinion, such lists quickly become outdated, and a good engineer can easily master any application tool if the principles of its operation are clear to him/her.

It's better [to read about the tasks being solved](/en/work/career/), [send a DM](https://t.me/gongled) or schedule a meeting with me to form your own impression.
