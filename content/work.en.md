### For employers

As a Technical Unit Lead, I am responsible for overseeing platform development teams, operations, and load testing engineers. I specialize in launching projects based on open-source software, establishing team processes, and implementing SRE practices [to reduce IT company costs and accelerate release cycles](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance).

I am approached for starting projects from scratch or bringing order to existing ones. My responsibilities include [developing and presenting initiatives](https://www.larksuite.com/en_us/blog/amazon-6-pager), organizing teams and processes, defining plans, gathering requirements, designing system architecture, evaluating reliability and performance, estimating cluster capacity, and selecting equipment to accommodate growth in workload.

In projects, I focus on infrastructure-as-code, utilizing configuration management systems and platforms. I prefer automating routine tasks to avoid duplicating work.

I improve system observability and monitor quality, capturing them in SLO/SLA agreements. I prioritize metrics that require attention and address false positives. Attention is also given to technical debt, striking a balance between feature growth and refactoring.

I set and validate goals (OKR, KPI) and am responsible for budgeting. I conduct technical interviews, [hire using topgrading techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topgrading), assess performance, delegate tasks, monitor progress, develop the team (TMM, performance reviews, competency matrices, 360 feedback), motivate team members, and resolve conflicts.

I lead incident resolution, facilitate retrospectives, write post-mortems, and investigate root causes to prevent recurrence. Technical documentation writing and organizing the company's knowledge base is another aspect of my role. I create diagrams, charts, reports, and instructions.

I engage in negotiations with clients, explain and justify proposed solutions while also defining goals using [the SMART framework](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals). Measuring the results based on technical and team metrics is part of my responsibilities.

I apply agile methodologies ([Scrum](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum), [Kanban](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)) for planning in uncertain conditions and utilize [the GTD approach](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) for personal task management. Timeliness is my priority, adhering to [the concept of immutable deadlines](https://fff.works/blog/all/caterpillar-nails/), and ensuring completion of tasks.

I contribute to DevRel activities, [organizing meetups and events](https://architecturalkatas.ru), assisting in [developing the IT brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_value_proposition), and [participating in speaking engagements in Russian language](/ru/public-speaking/). I am proficient in speaking and writing in Russian, English (C1), and German (B2).
